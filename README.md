# gamerockscissorspaper
The game rock paper scissors was implemented for nfactorial
1, 2, 3 buttons can be used to change the type of character.
Arrow keys are used for moving in 2D screen. 
The project was not finished and implemented in a last hour. And I was not able to upload music file. Sorry for that!
